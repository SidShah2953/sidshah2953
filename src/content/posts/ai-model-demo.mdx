> The example used here analyses Customer Churn Data using a Random Forrest Classifier. This is used for demonstrative purposes only and the steps, libraries and data used by you may vary.

## The Implementation Process

### Data Collection & Processing

- Start by collecting data from some verified data source.
- ⁠⁠Separate data into training and testing sets. Testing sets will only be used after the model has been selected. Data leakage is unacceptable.

Example Code:  

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    data = pd.read_csv('Data/Customer Churn.csv')

    data['Gender'] = oe.fit_transform(data[['Gender']])
    data['EmailOptIn'] = oe.fit_transform(data[['EmailOptIn']])
    data['PromotionResponse'] = oe.fit_transform(data[['PromotionResponse']])

    X = data.iloc[:,:-1]
    y = data.iloc[:,-1]
    ```

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedStratifiedKFold
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder 
oe = OrdinalEncoder()
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, recall_score, precision_score, f1_score

import torch
from torch.nn.functional import mse_loss
```

```python

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
                                        X,
                                        y,
                                        test_size=0.2,
                                        stratify=X['Gender'],
                                        random_state=1
                                        )
```

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()

grid = { 
    'n_estimators': [25 * i for i in range(1, 10 + 1)], 
    'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2'], 
    'max_depth': [3 * i for i in range(1, 5 + 1)], 
    'max_leaf_nodes': [2, 5, 10, 20, 50], 
}

cv = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(
    n_splits=10,
    n_repeats=3,
    random_state=1
    )
grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    estimator=model,
    param_grid=grid,
    n_jobs=-1,
    cv=cv,
    scoring='accuracy'
    )

grid_result = grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Highest Accuracy: {grid_result.best_score_:.4f}")
print(f"Hyper Parameter Values: {grid_result.best_params_}")
```

### ⁠Implement Models and Compare Performance

- ⁠Choose some Machine Learning Models. These will be implemented in Python using the Scikit-learn library, resources for which can be found at the end.
- ⁠Implement your selected models with various hyper-parameter values for each model.
- ⁠Train each such configuration on the training data set and evaluate it on the testing data set. Evaluation will consist of the following steps
    - After training, use the data from the testing set to make predictions.
    - Use these predictions and compare them with the actual values from the data.
    - Based on the predictions and the actual values, compute values of different metrics such as accuracy, recall, mean-squared error, or others depending on the use case.
    - Based on these metrics, choose the ideal model configuration.

### Insights & Analysis

- ⁠For the selected model, explain what the values of the metrics means and what the corresponding values imply. Explain why the particular metrics were chosen.
- ⁠Based on the model, give possible explanations and insights about the relation between the various values measured and the goal variable


## Possible topics
1. **⁠Pneumonia or Diabetes Prediction**:  
	Here, measured values will be vitals such as heart rate, body temperature, previous medical history, etc. The goal variable will be a binary value (0 or 1) denoting the absence or presence of the disease.
2. **⁠Wildfire Threat**:  
	Here the measured values will include distance from nearby forrest fire, settlements, water bodies, etc. The goal variable will be a score denoting how likely a wildfire is.

The values mentioned for each topic are not exhaustive. Other values can and should be used. The student should be able to justify the use of every value through some direct or indirect logic.
