## Finance 101

### Time Value of Money & Present Value

- **Money today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future.**  
    This is due to the potential for **earning interest** over time.
- **Present Value (PV):**  
    The current worth of a future sum of money, discounted back to the present using a specific **interest rate**. This helps compare future cash flows to their present value for investment decisions.
- **Discount rate:**  
    The interest rate used to discount future cash flows back to their present value.
    $$
    \text{PV} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1 + \text{Discount Rate})^{\text{Time}}}
    $$
    
### Cash Flows

A cash flow is any movement of money into or out of an entity (e.g., individual, company). It can be:
- **Positive:** Receiving money (income, investment returns)
- **Negative:** Spending money (expenses, loan payments)

### No-Arbitrage Principle

**Arbitrage**
- Arbitrage refers to taking advantage of price discrepancies between equivalent assets in different markets to make a *risk-free profit*. 

**Necessary Conditions for Arbitrage**
1. *Price discrepancy:*  
    There must be a difference in the price of the same or equivalent assets in different markets. This difference cannot be justified by fundamental factors like risk or liquidity.
2. *Risk-free:*  
    The arbitrage opportunity must be guaranteed to make a profit without any risk of loss. This means there are no transaction costs, execution risks, or potential changes in prices before you can exploit the discrepancy.
3. *Replicability:*  
    The arbitrage opportunity must be replicable by other investors.This ensures that the price discrepancy will be quickly eliminated, restoring market efficiency.

> __The No-Arbitrage Principle__:  
> In efficient markets, **equivalent assets should have the same risk-adjusted return**.  
> If an arbitrage opportunity exists, investors will take advantage of it, eliminating the price discrepancy, ensuring market efficiency and fair pricing of assets.
